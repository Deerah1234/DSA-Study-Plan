# DSA Study Plan

This repository contains my study plan for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) interview preparation. The plan is divided into different weeks, each focusing on specific topics and goals.

## Repository Structure

- [x] **Week 1-2: Data Structures**: Refreshing knowledge of arrays, strings, linked lists, stacks, and queues Studying trees, binary trees, graphs, hash tables, and heaps.
  - [x] - Arrays
  - [x] - Strings
  - [x] - Linked Lists
  - [x] - Stack
  - [x] - Queues
  - [x] - Trees
  - [x] - Binary Trees
  - [x] - Graphs
  - [x] - Hash tables
  - [x] - Heaps

- [x] **Week 3-4: Algorithms**: Implementing sorting and searching algorithms. Exploring graph algorithms, dynamic programming, recursion, backtracking, and greedy algorithms.

- [x] **Week 5-6: Problem-Solving Skills**: Solving coding problems on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and CodeSignal. Gradually increasing the difficulty level and focusing on problem-solving techniques.

- [x] **Week 7-8: System Design**: Understanding system design principles and practicing designing system architectures. Exploring scalability, load balancing, caching, and database design.

- [x] **Week 9-10: Mock Interviews and Practice**: Simulating real interview scenarios through mock interviews. Participating in coding competitions and analyzing performance.

- [ ] **Additional Resources**: Recommended books, online courses, and YouTube channels for further learning.

Feel free to explore the folders to find detailed study plans and resources for each week.

## Getting Started

To start with the study plan, follow the suggested roadmap in each week's folder. Use the provided resources, practice coding problems, and engage in mock interviews to enhance your skills.
