# Arrays

In this section, we will focus on the concept of arrays and their operations. Arrays are fundamental data structures that store elements of the same type in contiguous memory locations. They provide efficient random access to elements and are widely used in various algorithms and applications.

## Goals

- Understand the basics of arrays, including their structure and properties.
- Learn about common array operations, such as insertion, deletion, and searching.
- Explore different techniques for manipulating arrays and optimizing their usage.
- Implement various algorithms and solve coding problems using arrays.

## Topics Covered

- Array representation and initialization.
- Array traversal and accessing elements.
- Array operations: insertion, deletion, searching, and updating.
- Sorting and searching algorithms for arrays.
- Multidimensional arrays.
- Dynamic arrays and ArrayLists (if applicable to your programming language).
