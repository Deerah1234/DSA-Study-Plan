1. The goal is to find the kth node from the end of a linked list. We can achieve this by using two pointers: a slow pointer and a fast pointer. The fast pointer is moved k steps ahead initially. Then, both pointers are moved together until the fast pointer reaches the end. At this point, the slow pointer will be pointing at the kth node from the end.

    why must we move fast k times fist?

    Moving the `fast_pointer` k steps ahead in the linked list before starting the traversal with both pointers is a crucial step in the algorithm to efficiently find the kth node from the end. This step is necessary because it establishes a separation between the two pointers, ensuring that they are at a specific distance from each other.

    Here's why moving the `fast_pointer` k times first is important:

    1. **Create a Gap:** Moving the `fast_pointer` k steps ahead effectively creates a gap of k nodes between the `fast_pointer` and the `slow_pointer`. This gap allows the `slow_pointer` to be positioned at the correct distance from the end of the linked list.

    2. **Establish Relative Positioning:** By the time the `fast_pointer` is k nodes ahead, the `slow_pointer` will be at the beginning of the gap. This relative positioning of the pointers ensures that when both pointers start moving together, the `slow_pointer` will be k steps away from the `fast_pointer`.

    3. **Efficient Traversal:** Once the gap is established, you can start traversing both pointers simultaneously. Since the gap is k nodes wide, the `slow_pointer` will reach the kth node from the end precisely when the `fast_pointer` reaches the end of the linked list.

    This approach optimizes the traversal process by using the gap to directly locate the kth node from the end without needing to know the length of the linked list beforehand. It's a key part of the algorithm that enables the efficient and accurate retrieval of the kth node from the end.
