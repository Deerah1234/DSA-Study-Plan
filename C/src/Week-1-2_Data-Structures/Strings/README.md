# Strings

In this section, we will focus on strings, which are a fundamental data type in many programming languages. Understanding string manipulation and algorithms is important for solving various coding problems and interview questions.

## Goals

- Understand the basic properties and operations of strings.
- Learn about common string manipulation techniques.
- Practice solving coding problems involving strings.
- Analyze time and space complexities of string algorithms.

## Topics Covered

- String operations (concatenation, substring, length, etc.).
- String manipulation (reversal, case conversion, character counting, etc.).
- String searching algorithms (brute force, Knuth-Morris-Pratt, Boyer-Moore, etc.).
- Anagram detection and string permutation.
- Palindrome detection.
- Regular expressions and pattern matching.
- String compression and encoding.
