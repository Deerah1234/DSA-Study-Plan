# Tree

*Tree is a non-linear Data Structure.*

Tree can be defined as a collection of entities ( node ) linked together to *simulate a hierarchy*

## Terminologies

- Root: The top most element ( node ) in the tree.
- Nodes: Store some information and also containing element of another node.
- ParentNode: The imidate *predecessor* of any node.
- ChildNode: The imidate *succesor* of a node.
- Leaf node: The node which has no child; there are also know as *external* node.
- Non-leaf node: The node which has aleast one child; there are also know as *internal* node.
- Path: Sequence of consecutive edges from source node to destination node.
- Ancestor: Any predecessor node on the path from root to that node.
- Decendant: Any sucessor node on the path from that node to leaf node.
- Sub-Tree: The sub-tree is containing a node of all it's decendants.
- Sibling: All the children of same parent node.
- Degree: The number of children of that node.
- Degree of tree: Max degree among all node.
- Depth of node: Length of path from root to that node; number of edges from the root to that node.
- Height of node: Number of edges in the longest path from that node to a leaf.
- Height of tree: Is Equal to the height of the root node.
- Level of node: the distance from root to the given node; also equal to depth of the node.
- Level of tree: is equal height of a tree.

*Nnodes => (n-1)edges.*
