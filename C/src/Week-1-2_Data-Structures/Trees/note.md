# Tree

Tree can be defined as a collection of entities ( node ) linked together to simulate a hierarchy

## Terminology

- Root: the top most element ( node ) in the tree.
- Nodes: store some information and also containing element of another node.
- ParentNode: the imidate predecessor of any node.
- ChildNode: the imidate succesor of a node.
- Leaf node: The node which has no child; there are also know as external node.
- Non-leaf node: The node which has aleast one child; there are also know as internal node.
- Path: Sequence of consecutive edges from source node to destination node.
- Ancestor: any predecesspr node on the path from root to that node.
- Decendant: Any sucessor node on the path from that node to leaf node.
- Sub-Tree: The sub-tree is containing a node of all it's decendants.
- Sibling: all the children of same parent node.
- Degree: the number of child of that node.
- Degree of tree: max degree among all node.
- Depth od node: length of path from root to that node; number of edges from the root to that node.
- Height of node: number of edges in the longest path from that node to a leaf.
